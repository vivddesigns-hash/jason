Call this when something happened that the user would want to know about — a completed task with a notable outcome, an interesting observation, a positive trend you noticed in monitored data, useful research worth surfacing, a workflow that got blocked, a credential or token failure, etc. Do not call it for routine task completions where nothing notable happened. When in doubt and you have a real observation to share, share it.

## Sending Notifications

Always pass `--title`. Skipping it triggers a fallback that just truncates `--message` to 60 chars and shows it as the title — the user sees the same text twice with no scannability gained.

```bash
assistant notifications send \
  --title "Short headline" \
  --message "Your verbatim observation in your own words"
```

For time-sensitive items:

```bash
assistant notifications send --title "..." --message "..." --urgent
```

### Command Reference

| Flag                  | Required        | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--message <message>` | Yes             | Notification body. Markdown (GFM) renders in the detail panel; the OS banner shows plain text.                                                       |
| `--title <title>`     | Yes in practice | Short headline (≤ 8 words). Omitting it triggers a body-truncation fallback that shows up as a duplicate of `--message` — always write a real title. |
| `--urgent`            | No              | Mark as needing attention now/soon                                                                                                                   |
| `--json`              | No              | Output machine-readable JSON                                                                                                                         |

### Title

Write a `--title` for every notification. It's the only line the user sees in the lock-screen popup and the collapsed row of the notification list, so a short noun phrase (≤ 8 words) is what makes the notification scannable. If you omit `--title`, the system falls back to the first sentence of `--message` (truncated at 60 chars) — that's almost always worse than what you'd write, because it duplicates body text the user is already going to read.

Avoid restating the first sentence of `--message` verbatim — the title should add scannability, not duplicate.

### Message

The body renders as markdown (GFM) in the home feed detail panel — where the user actually opens the notification on web, iOS, and macOS. Light markdown makes multi-fact bodies scannable. The OS lock-screen banner shows the body as plain text, so prefer inline emphasis over heavy structure that looks ugly unrendered.

Supported: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `inline code` ``, fenced code blocks, links, bulleted and numbered lists, blockquotes, headings, GFM tables, `~~strikethrough~~`.

Use it like this:

- **Bold** the headline fact when the body has more than one sentence.
- Bullets or numbered lists when surfacing multiple discrete items (failures, files touched, missed messages).
- Inline `code` for identifiers, paths, commands, and short snippets.
- Fenced code blocks for multi-line output (stack traces, diffs).

Avoid large headings (`#`, `##`) and wide tables — they render fine in the panel but look noisy in the banner preview.

### Urgent semantics

Use `--urgent` for items needing attention now/soon (blocked work, broken auth, time-sensitive issues). Skip for items the user should see when they have time.

### Examples

```bash
# Plain notification — bold the headline fact
assistant notifications send \
  --title "Backup complete" \
  --message "Nightly backup finished — **12.4 GB** archived to cold storage across **3** datasets."

# Urgent notification — inline code for the identifier
assistant notifications send \
  --title "Auth token expired" \
  --message "Sync is paused until you reauthenticate the \`GitHub\` integration." \
  --urgent
```

### Response Format

```json
{ "ok": true, "signalId": "...", "dispatched": true }
```

## Reading Surfaced Notifications

```bash
assistant notifications list --json
```

Reads from the user's home feed (`$jason_WORKSPACE_DIR/data/home-feed.json`) — the inbox that mirrors background and async notifications surfaced via the unified pipeline. Real-time chat pushes that did not mirror to the feed (direct Telegram/Slack/Jason-chat sends without `--is-async-background`) will not appear here.

### When to call

- **Before sending**: check whether you already surfaced a similar item recently (filter by `--conversation-id` or `--after` to dedupe).
- **Catch-up summaries**: when the user asks "what did I miss" or returns after a session break, list the items they haven't dismissed.
- **Lookup**: when the user references a past notification ("the email thing you flagged earlier"), find it by `--conversation-id` or date range.

### Filters

| Flag                               | Purpose                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--all`                            | Include dismissed items (default: excluded — assistant cares about outstanding work)                     |
| `--status <s>`                     | Filter by status (`new` / `seen` / `acted_on` / `dismissed`); repeatable. Overrides the `--all` default. |
| `--before <iso>` / `--after <iso>` | ISO-8601 createdAt bounds (strict; `=` is excluded).                                                     |
| `--urgency <u>`                    | Filter by urgency (`low` / `medium` / `high` / `critical`); repeatable.                                  |
| `--category <c>`                   | Filter by category (`security` / `scheduling` / `background` / `email` / `system`); repeatable.          |
| `--conversation-id <id>`           | Only items tied to this conversation.                                                                    |
| `--from-assistant`                 | Only items the assistant herself emitted.                                                                |
| `--noteworthy`                     | Only items flagged as noteworthy.                                                                        |
| `--limit <n>`                      | Default 20, max 200.                                                                                     |
| `--offset <n>`                     | Pagination offset. Combine with `--limit` to walk older pages.                                           |

### Examples

```bash
# What's outstanding right now (defaults: skip dismissed, newest first)
assistant notifications list --json

# Everything you've shown the user today
assistant notifications list --after 2026-05-28T00:00:00Z --all --json

# Only high-stakes items
assistant notifications list --urgency high --urgency critical --json

# Pre-send dedupe: anything you already surfaced for this conversation
assistant notifications list --conversation-id 7fab234c --after 2026-05-28T00:00:00Z --json

# Walk older pages
assistant notifications list --limit 20 --offset 20 --json
```

### Response shape

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "items": [
    /* FeedItem records: id, title?, summary, status, urgency?, category?, conversationId?, createdAt, ... */
  ],
  "total": 12,
  "returned": 3,
  "hasMore": true,
  "updatedAt": "2026-05-28T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Editing Notifications

Use `edit` when an already-sent notification needs revising — a typo in the body, a status update on something you previously surfaced (e.g. "in progress" → "done"), or de-escalating the urgency of a stale alert. **Prefer editing over re-sending**: a fresh notification with the corrected text creates duplicate noise in the user's inbox and pings them twice.

```bash
assistant notifications edit --id <notif:uuid> --message "Corrected body"
```

### Finding the id

The `id` field is the full `notif:<uuid>` printed by `notifications list --json` under `items[].id`. Bare uuids (without the `notif:` prefix) are also accepted.

```bash
assistant notifications list --json | jq '.items[] | {id, title, summary}'
```

### Command Reference

| Flag                | Required | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--id <id>`         | Yes      | Feed item id (`notif:<uuid>`) or bare uuid                                                           |
| `--message <text>`  | No\*     | New body — updates the home-feed summary AND the delivered channel message where supported           |
| `--title <text>`    | No\*     | New short headline (≤ 8 words)                                                                       |
| `--urgency <level>` | No\*     | Change urgency (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`critical`). **Feed-only** — does not re-push channel messages |
| `--status <state>`  | No\*     | Lifecycle transition (`new`/`seen`/`acted_on`/`dismissed`). **Feed-only**                            |
| `--json`            | No       | Machine-readable JSON                                                                                |

\*At least one of `--message`, `--title`, `--urgency`, or `--status` must be supplied.

### Channel behavior

| Channel                     | Edit behavior                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Home feed (macOS/iOS inbox) | Always updated when the item exists.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Slack                       | Updated in-place via `chat.update` when the original delivery captured a Slack `ts`. Deliveries older than this feature returned `messageId: null` and report `outcome: "unsupported"`. |
| Push, email, SMS            | Cannot be edited — reported as `outcome: "unsupported"` in the result.                                                                                                                  |

### Response shape

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "feedItem": {
    "id": "notif:...",
    "title": "...",
    "summary": "...",
    "status": "new",
    "urgency": "low"
  },
  "channels": [
    { "channel": "slack", "deliveryId": "...", "outcome": "updated" },
    {
      "channel": "platform",
      "deliveryId": "...",
      "outcome": "unsupported",
      "reason": "platform adapter does not support in-place edits"
    }
  ]
}
```

`outcome` values: `"updated"` (channel message edited successfully), `"unsupported"` (channel cannot edit at all), `"skipped"` (delivery wasn't in `sent` status), `"failed"` (channel-side error — see `reason`).

### Examples

```bash
# Fix a typo in the body
assistant notifications edit \
  --id notif:abc12345-... \
  --message "Backup completed — 12.4 GB archived to cold storage."

# De-escalate an urgent alert that resolved itself
assistant notifications edit --id notif:abc12345-... --urgency low

# Dismiss a notification you previously surfaced
assistant notifications edit --id notif:abc12345-... --status dismissed
```

## Important

- Do **NOT** use AppleScript `display notification` or other OS-level notification commands for assistant-managed alerts. Always use `assistant notifications send`.
- For sending rich content (digests, summaries, reports) to a specific chat or email destination, use the appropriate platform's API directly. For Gmail, use `messaging_send`. For Slack, use the Slack Web API directly (see the **slack** skill).
- Send notifications that fire **immediately** with no delay capability. For one-time future alerts, use `schedule_create` with `fire_at`. For recurring alerts, use `schedule_create` with an expression (cron/RRULE).

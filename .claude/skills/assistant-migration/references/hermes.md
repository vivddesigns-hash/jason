# Hermes → Jason

Hermes is NousResearch's open-source self-hosted agent. It uses the same `agentskills.io` skill standard as Jason, so most of its internals map cleanly.

## Data directory locations

| Platform          | Path                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Linux             | `~/.hermes/`                     |
| macOS             | `~/.hermes/`                     |
| WSL2 (Linux side) | `~/.hermes/`                     |
| Termux            | `~/.hermes/`                     |
| Windows native    | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\`         |
| Docker (default)  | bind-mount of `/var/lib/hermes/` |

Confirm with the creator before bundling — they may have set `HERMES_HOME` to override the default.

## What's inside (and how it maps)

| Path inside the data directory   | Jason destination            | Bucket             |

| `cache/`, `logs/`                | —                             | Skip               |

## Pre-bundle safety

- **Is Hermes still running?** A held WAL on `memory.db` means yes. Either ask Hermes to stop, or copy `memory.db` to a snapshot first:
  ```sh
  sqlite3 ~/.hermes/memory.db ".backup ~/.hermes/memory.db.snapshot"
  ```
  Then bundle the snapshot. Never tar a SQLite file with a live WAL — the snapshot will be corrupt on read.
- **Confirm size**: `du -sh ~/.hermes` before bundling. If the directory is over ~1 GB, drop `memory.db` from the first pass and bring Memory across in a second migration once the metadata-only bundle has been reviewed.

## Bundle recipe

### bash (Linux / macOS / WSL2 / Termux)

```sh
tar -czf hermes-migration.tar.gz \
  --exclude='memory.db-wal' \
  --exclude='memory.db-shm' \
  --exclude='memory.db.fts5*' \
  --exclude='cache' \
  --exclude='logs' \
  --exclude='tokens' \
  --exclude='oauth/refresh' \
  --exclude='cookies.json' \
  --exclude='.env' \
  --exclude='*.key' \
  --exclude='*.pem' \
  --exclude='*.refresh_token' \
  -C "$HOME" .hermes/
```

### PowerShell (Windows native)

```powershell
$src = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hermes"
$staging = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "$env:TEMP\hermes-stage" -Force
Copy-Item -Path $src -Destination $staging -Recurse

$exclude = @(
  "memory.db-wal","memory.db-shm","memory.db.fts5*",
  "cache","logs","tokens","oauth",
  "cookies.json",".env","*.key","*.pem","*.refresh_token"
)
foreach ($pattern in $exclude) {
  Get-ChildItem $staging -Recurse -Force -Filter $pattern -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
    Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
}

Compress-Archive -Path "$staging\*" -DestinationPath hermes-migration.zip
Remove-Item $staging -Recurse -Force
```

(Windows users can substitute `.zip` for `.tar.gz` throughout — the assistant handles both.)

## Transport

Attach `hermes-migration.tar.gz` directly to the chat. The assistant lands it in its workspace and extracts to a scratch directory.

For archives that exceed the current channel's attachment limit, split the bundle and upload in sequence (see the `--exclude` pattern above for ideas — a metadata-only first pass that drops `memory.db`, followed by a memory-only second pass, is a common shape). If a chunk is still too large to upload, copy it onto the assistant's host out-of-band (scp/rsync/USB) and tell the assistant the on-disk path. **Do not** paste a hosted URL into chat and ask the assistant to `curl` it — chat-supplied URLs interpolated into a shell command are a shell-substitution + SSRF + URL-safety-bypass surface, and bash is auto-approved on platform-hosted profiles.

## After import — secrets rebind checklist

The archive carries no secrets. Each of these must be re-established through Jason before the migrated assistant can act:

- **Inference providers** (one per row in `providers.json`):
  `assistant oauth connect <provider>` for managed providers, or `assistant credentials prompt` for raw API keys
- **MCP servers** (one per entry in `mcp.json`): walk the connect flow for each; bearer tokens go through `assistant credentials prompt`
- **Gateway channels** (one per binding in `gateway/accounts.json`): re-OAuth or paste bot token via secure prompt — **never via chat text**
- **Cron / schedule notifications**: any schedule that delivers via a channel needs the channel rebound first

When in doubt, pause and ask before sending any production-grade message on a newly migrated channel.
